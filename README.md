Hello and welcome to my Github profile! I'm a passionate and driven Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript, Ruby, React, and Rails. My journey into the realm of coding started quite early on; I've been hooked ever since I built my first Minecraft server in 4th grade for my friends and me. I fell in the love with the process of creating something with technology and I see this moment as the "lightbulb". I continued to dabble and explore the world of coding when I decided that wanted to build my own computer in 6th grade. After a year of saving money and research I built it in 7th and I still use it to this day. This experience was the other major moment in my life where I knew that I didn't want to be involved with any thing else other than tech

Educational Journey 
 After taking some highschool and college classes, I decided to take a chance and join the App Academy bootcamp to learn the technology thats being used today and jump start my career as a softeware engineer

 Skills and Specialties-
 JavaScript: Proficient in ES6+ and server-side development using Node.js.
Ruby: Well-versed in creating efficient back-end systems with Ruby on Rails.
React: Experienced in building responsive and intuitive front-end applications.
Rails: Skilled in constructing robust APIs and server-side solutions.

Projects and Collaborations-
 During my time at App Acadmey, I have worked on different projects eaching using different tech Stacks. One project I am excited about is a Discord clone where users can chat with each other in real time.

Continuous Learning- 
 In this ever-evolving field, staying up-to-date is crucial. I am continuously looking to expand my skill set through online courses, open-source contributions, and attending tech meet-ups. I am an active member of several coding communities, where I both learn from and mentor aspiring developers.

Let's Connect!
